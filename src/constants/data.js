Chris has had the playing experience with pro team Kitchee (Hong Kong) and semi-pro team Ventura County (California, US). He found himself wanting to continue being involved in football and coached the Johns Hopkins University Club Soccer team as a volunteer in 2011-2012. With a FA level 1 completed back in 2004, he knew he needed to further his football education, so he enrolled with the IFA (Northern Irish Football Association) UEFA B course in 2016 - 2017 and as of June 2021 is currently on the FAW (Football Association of Wales) as he looks to continue through the UEFA coaching tiers.",
