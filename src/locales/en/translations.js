    machine4description: "The Precision Wall helps players develop their attacking attributes, like shooting accuracy, first-touch, and teamwork.

Having been introduced to the private coaching sector over the course of the lockdown in Hong Kong, he found that this particular area was not catering to the needs of the players and wanted to provide a more immersive experience. Chris has had playing experience with pro team Kitchee (Hong Kong) and semi-pro team Ventura County (California, US). He found himself wanting to continue being involved in football and coached the Johns Hopkins University Club Soccer team as a volunteer in 2011-2012. With a FA level 1 completed in 2004, he knew he needed to further his football education, so he enrolled with the IFA (Northern Irish Football Association) UEFA B course in 2016 - 2017 and as of June 2021 is currently on the FAW (Football Association of Wales) as he looks to continue through the UEFA coaching tiers.",
