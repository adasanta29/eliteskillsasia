      <h2>Sam Trayford - General Director</h2>
      <p>Sam has been in and out of Hong Kong his whole life having been born in the city. He has had a huge passion for football from a young age playing in both Hong Kong and the UK. This passion is what led him to be involved with Elite Skills Arena (ESA) UK. He returned to Hong Kong in 2017 bringing the ESA brand and the products that come with it. He helped expand the brand across East Asia in regions such as China, Thailand and Japan. Having identified the quality of training and enjoyment participants get from the use of ESA products he decided a permanent location was needed, and so the ESA Hong Kong Training Centre was born!</p>

      <h2>Chris de Laiglesia - Technical Director</h2>
      <p>Chris has been coaching in Hong Kong since 2015 working with players of all ages, from 2 year olds learning the basics up to adults in the Hong Kong professional league. Having been introduced to the private coaching sector over the course of the lockdown in Hong Kong, he found that this particular area was not catering to the needs of the players and wanted to provide a more immersive experience. Chris has had playing experience with pro team Kitchee (Hong Kong) and semi-pro team Ventura County (California, US). He found himself wanting to continue being involved in football and coached the Johns Hopkins University Club Soccer team as a volunteer in 2011-2012. With a FA level 1 completed in 2004, he knew he needed to further his football education, so he enrolled with the IFA (Northern Irish Football Association) UEFA B course in 2016 - 2017 and as of June 2021 is currently on the FAW (Football Association of Wales) as he looks to continue through the UEFA coaching tiers.</p>
